    "\n",
    "Read the final assignment instructions from the course [webpage](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/final-assignment/final-assignment.html). Remember to write readable code, and to provide adequate documentation using inline comments and markdown. Organize all your documents into this repository and add your codes and written parts to the [final_assignment.ipynb](final_assignment.ipynb) Notebook. In sum, anyone who downloads this repository should be able to **read your code and documentation** and understand what is going on, and **run your code** in order to reproduce the same results! \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Note 1:** You can upload your poster as a Powerpoint or as a PDF file to this same repository if the size is less than 100 MB. Hint: you can upload files directly via browser by i) pressing the `Add file` -button and then ii) `Upload files` -button on the Github.\n",

    "- **Note 2:** If your code requires some python packages not found in the csc notebooks environment, please mention them also in this readme and provide installation instrutions.\n",

    "- **Note 4:** Cite relevant literature related to the topic, and also add links to websites, tutorials books or articles that you found useful. If you got help from your course mates please also mention it in your report.\n",

    "### Code of conduct\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final assignment you will work as a team. **Inclusion, kindness and respect should be the guiding principles in the way of working in your group**. In practice, this means being compassionate to yourself and others, respect different viewpoints, identities and backgrounds, and apologizing when needed. Let's make this project a shared space for the process of learning & unlearning. Do not hesitate to contact Henrikki in case you have any worries regarding the code of conduct. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before you can start programming, you need to launch the CSC Notebook instance and clone your **personal copy of the Exercise repository** (i.e. something like `exercise-3-htenkanen`) there using Git. If you need help with this, [read the documentation on the course site](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L1/git-basics.html).\n",
