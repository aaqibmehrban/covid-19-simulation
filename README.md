# Final Assignment

## Status

Once you are finished with the final assignment, edit this readme and add "x" to the correct box:

* [ ] Submitted

* [x] We are still working on the final assignment. 


## Gathering your team members

This assignment is a **group assignment**, i.e. when you accept the Github Classroom, it is possible for you to i) **create a team** OR ii) **join to an existing team**.

Before starting the final assignment, **you need to communicate with your group members, who will create the team and give it an appropriate name** (e.g. *Group 1*), so that others can find and join the team. After this process, your team will have a shared repository for the final assignment and you can all access it with your Github accounts.
